Marx's historical materialism emphasizes that the mode of production determines the course of history, and he believed that capitalism's relentless pursuit of growth and technological progress would lead to greater exploitation of both workers and nature. He would likely argue that digitalization, while potentially increasing productivity, could also exacerbate the existing problems of alienation and exploitation, particularly if it is not accompanied by significant changes in the social and economic structures.
In this context, Marx would likely advocate for a more equitable distribution of resources and a redefinition of abundance that prioritizes sustainability over consumerism. He would emphasize the need for a profound societal transformation that addresses the root causes of exploitation and alienation, rather than simply relying on technological advancements to resolve environmental and social issues.

En quoi cet outil se distingue des autres ?
