AI Perplexity:
Karl Marx would likely have critiqued the working conditions under green growth, particularly in light of the pervasive impact of digitalization, by highlighting the potential for increased exploitation and alienation. Marx believed that capitalism, including its technological advancements, perpetuates an exploitative and alienating production system that ultimately leads to greater social and ecological problems. He saw capitalism as a necessary but temporary step towards a more equitable and sustainable society, which would be achieved through socialism and ultimately communism.
Marx's historical materialism emphasizes that the mode of production determines the course of history, and he believed that capitalism's relentless pursuit of growth and technological progress would lead to greater exploitation of both workers and nature. He would likely argue that digitalization, while potentially increasing productivity, could also exacerbate the existing problems of alienation and exploitation, particularly if it is not accompanied by significant changes in the social and economic structures.
In this context, Marx would likely advocate for a more equitable distribution of resources and a redefinition of abundance that prioritizes sustainability over consumerism. He would emphasize the need for a profound societal transformation that addresses the root causes of exploitation and alienation, rather than simply relying on technological advancements to resolve environmental and social issues.
