Second axis: Conformité aux droits des utilisateurs. The policy says users can contact them with questions, but there's no clear procedure for exercising RGPD rights like access or deletion. The contact info is vague—just a "contact me" without specifics. Conditions for portability or deletion aren't mentioned. Potential abusive clauses: the third parties having access to data but only for assigned tasks. But how is that monitored? Maybe a red flag here.
Third axis: Sécurité et gouvernance. They mention using commercially acceptable security measures but admit no method is 100% secure. No details on specific security measures. Transparency on incidents: no mention of breach notification procedures. Data sharing with third parties is mentioned, but policies of those third parties are linked (though the link isn't provided here). Sensitive data guarantees: not addressed unless third parties handle it.
Fourth axis: Points de vigilance spécifiques. Use of AI or algorithms isn't mentioned. Compliance with DSA/DMA isn't addressed, but maybe not applicable here. Recourse mechanisms: just contacting them, no mention of data protection authorities. Zones grises: the statement that data is retained on the device but third parties collect it is unclear. Also, the policy says they don't collect cookies, but third parties might. That's a contradiction or lack of clarity.
Putting it all together, the main issues are lack of transparency about third-party data collection, unclear procedures for user rights, and vague security measures. The risk level might be moderate to high because users aren't fully informed about data practices, and third-party handling isn't detailed.
